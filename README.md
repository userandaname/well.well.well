A documentary of @historydex/[@seifcume](https://discord.com/users/1029171830973530132)/[@microsoft_cortana](https://discord.com/users/1183599021365932139), and his abuse among server moderators, Discord users, bot owners/developers, etc.
(this is for informational purposes only, no hard feelings!)

I'd like to give a warm thanks to Cyteon, Sky, dimkauzh, goos.exe, k_z. (iakzs), and other sources that have wished to remain anonymous for help with my research on these. You could be here too, if you aren't already ;)

The remainder of this README.md has been delayed, due to the sheer amount of evidence that I have on my hands, so a full story WILL come at some point, just not yet, so stay on the look-out!
